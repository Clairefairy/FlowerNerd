Darwin was ridiculed for his prediction. It was not until 21 years after Darwin’s death, in 1903, that his prediction was finally verified when the very large moth in question was discovered in Madagascar.

If an odd number, the inquirer will remain unmarried in the near future. If the total is an even number, soon there will be marriage. If one of the seeds has been cut, the relationship will be volatile; if two seeds have been cut, widowhood is the foretelling.",
